### Hi there citizen of the internet! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Esra'a, pronounced " Ess-raa' ". I love tackling new challenges and collaborating with all kinds of interesting people along the way. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on algorithms for creating general world models that help agents plan efficiently in a big world.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a downhill skiing enthusiast. One of my dreams is try all the major North American ski hills at least once.
